# Where things stand

**Read this first, before proposing anything.** `docs/todo.md` says what needs
doing; this says what is already true, and who is being waited on. It exists
because a session proposed rehearsing a payment flow that had been watched
finish on a phone the day before — written down in `DEALIO.md`, unread.

One screen. Dated lines. Delete what stops being true rather than striking it
through, and add the date to anything that changes.

## Waiting on other people

| | |
|---|---|
| **Airwallex — the account** | Application **pending review**, 21 Sep. Business verification complete, nothing marked action-required, named contact **Ian Cheah** (Growth Executive, Melbourne). Nothing owed by us. |
| **Airwallex — Connected Accounts** | Raised in their chat, routed to Ian, then **parked on purpose**: it is the reps-with-storefronts product, and describing it means describing the goods business. Revisit once the base account is live and has volume. |
| **Airwallex — the goods business** | Not disclosed yet. Deliberate. To be raised with Ian **before** anything from the shop runs through the account. |
| **Stripe** | Closed the account, September 2026. A hard no. Not a route back. |

## Dealio — the payment half

The whole chain was **watched finish on 20 September 2026**: request minted
from a terminal, link opened in WeChat on a phone, PAY, WeChat Pay, a real
Airwallex code long-pressed, paid on Airwallex's side, and the row went green
with nothing of ours looking at it. `make pay-check` counted it.

So the only untested thing is **real money**, and it is one line:
`BOARD_WALLET_AIRWALLEX_SANDBOX=0`, which `make airwallex-keys … LIVE=1`
writes when the live pair exists.

**Broken right now (21 Sep):** the box holds a rejected key pair. An earlier
version of `airwallex-keys` wrote before it tested, and a live pair pasted
against the sandbox host overwrote the working sandbox keys. The script now
proves first and writes second, but the good keys are gone — a fresh sandbox
pair through the same command restores it. Until then no request draws a code.

Money **out** to other people is not built and refuses on purpose: local CNY
payouts are documented only for goods trade with declarant and order data. See
note 2 at the top of `board/lib/wallet/providers/airwallex.js`.

## The shop

Built and live: catalogue with shelves, cart, checkout, orders, 我的订单,
确认收货, reviews, 问大家, 联系店家 threads, 我的小店 with the rep leaderboard
and 提现, commission accounting, hand-payment lists.

Not built: the AI assistant behind the AI REP ON/OFF switch (the switch stays
hidden until it exists), and the 微店 review import.

Its payments are **not** on Airwallex and must not be until the conversation
above has happened. `aozhoubaba.com` is its domain.

## Mail

| | |
|---|---|
| `mo@thexchange.app` | Porkbun **forward** into `tommyshanahan@gmail.com`. The address on the Airwallex application. |
| `tom@thexchange.app` | Porkbun **mailbox**, free trial, 10GB, renews at US$36/yr. Gmail sends as it through `smtp.porkbun.com:587` with reply-to `mo@`. Mail sent *to* it sits in Porkbun webmail — Gmail dropped POP fetching in January 2026, and an address cannot be a mailbox and a forward at once. |
| `tom@globalpeoplesmedia.com` | Send-as removed from Gmail, 21 Sep. Still receives. |
