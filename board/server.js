// The board: a noticeboard for foreigners in China.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// What this is, and what it deliberately is not
//
// Study Pal's feed with nothing else attached — no translator, no camera, no
// flashcards. Somewhere to ask "where do I get a phone contract without a
// Chinese bank card" and be answered by somebody who did it last month.
//
// It is not a copy of Study Pal's data. It starts empty. The posts on that
// side were made by people who signed up to that app, and moving their words
// and photographs into a different product is not a migration, it is a
// decision about somebody else's content.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// It answers the admin panel's API, exactly
//
// The panel on tomscoding already governs a board — reading /api/public,
// sending to /api/feed, releasing and deleting. Those routes are implemented
// here to the same contract, so pointing STUDYPAL_BASE at this service makes
// that panel govern this board with no change to a line of it.
//
// That is not a coincidence and it is worth stating: the contract was written
// down before either side was finished, which is why a second implementation
// of it took an evening rather than a week.
